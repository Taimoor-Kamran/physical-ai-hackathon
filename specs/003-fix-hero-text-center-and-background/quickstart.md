# Quickstart: Center Hero Text and Remove Background

## Overview
This feature implements horizontal centering for the hero section text container and removes the white background behind the text to allow the background image to show through, improving visual consistency.

## Implementation Steps
1. Locate the hero component in the Docusaurus theme (likely in index.tsx)
2. Identify the CSS selectors for the hero text container
3. Apply centering styles using CSS
4. Remove background color from the text container
5. Test readability and responsiveness across device sizes

## Files to Modify
- `frontend/src/pages/index.tsx` (or hero component)
- `frontend/src/css/custom.css` (or related CSS file)

## Testing
1. Verify text is centered on desktop
2. Verify text remains centered on mobile and tablet
3. Check that white background is removed
4. Ensure text readability is maintained
5. Verify button positioning remains correct
