# Data Model: Fix Hero Design Consistency

## Entities

This feature does not introduce any new data entities. It is purely a UI/UX enhancement focusing on CSS styling changes to achieve visual consistency between the hero section and footer.

## Data Flow

No data flow changes are required for this feature. All changes are limited to presentation layer (CSS) modifications.

## State Management

No state management changes are required. The design changes are static styling modifications that do not affect application state.
