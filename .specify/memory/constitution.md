# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – From Digital Brain to Embodied Intelligence Constitution

## Core Principles

### Comprehensive Book Content
The book must be fully written in Markdown/MDX using Docusaurus, and deployed on GitHub Pages via Spec-Kit Plus. Every chapter must strictly adhere to the 13-week curriculum outlined in the hackathon brief.

### Interactive RAG Chatbot
A fully functional RAG chatbot must be embedded within the book, built with OpenAI Agents SDK or ChatKit + FastAPI + Neon Postgres + Qdrant Cloud Free Tier. The RAG bot MUST support selected-text queries, allowing users to highlight text and receive answers based solely on that selection.

### Open Source and AI-Generated Code
The entire book must be 100% open-source with an MIT license and deployed live on GitHub Pages. All code in the project must be generated by Claude, with human roles limited to reviews and command execution.

### Automated RAG Indexing
The RAG index must be automatically updated on every push via GitHub Actions and Qdrant.

## Technical & Content Style Guidelines

- **Base Template**: Use only Spec-Kit Plus as the base template.
- **Code Generation**: All code must be generated by Claude; human roles are limited to review and command execution.
- **Licensing & Deployment**: The book must be 100% open-source, MIT license, and deployed live on GitHub Pages.
- **RAG Index Updates**: The RAG index must be updated automatically on every push via GitHub Actions + Qdrant.
- **Language Mix**: Roman Urdu + English mix is allowed in explanations to cater to the target audience in Pakistan.
- **Technical Concept Presentation**: Every technical concept must include: Theory → Code → Gazebo/Isaac Sim screenshot → Real robot mapping.
- **Visuals**: Use abundant diagrams, flowcharts, and comparison tables.
- **Lab Exercises**: Each chapter must conclude with a "Lab Exercise" section, including clear hardware requirements.

## Chapter Structure

The book will strictly follow this chapter order:
- Module 0: Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System → ROS 2 Deep Dive
- Module 2: The Digital Twin → Gazebo + Unity + Isaac Sim
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain → NVIDIA Isaac ROS & Sim
- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models
- Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid with Voice Commands

## Governance

- This Constitution supersedes all other practices.
- Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
- All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
- Complexity must be justified and aligned with the project's mission.
- The motto "We are building the future of AI education in Pakistan – one line of code at a time. Jazba rakh. Kaam kar. Jeet haq hai hamara. 🚀 Pakistan Zindabad." guides all development.
